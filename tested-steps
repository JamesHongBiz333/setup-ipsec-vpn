1, First you need a vpn server to connect, I tested and recommand https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8357225, to setup your first vpn server, and I strongly recommand you can test it with debain OS, I just mean I tested it with debain OS. For my objective is just setting up a vpn server to use without care its OS.

2, After setting up your new instance in VULTR, you can connect to your server by ssh, then just run this 
wget https://git.io/vpnsetup -O vpnsetup.sh && sudo sh vpnsetup.sh

3, After the script finished, in terminal it will show you all info you will need to connect to vpn server in screen, and make sure you don't miss it.

4, Use your favourite vpn client and #3 provided cridentials to connect to your vpn server.

5, Enjoy :)
